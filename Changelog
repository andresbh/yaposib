O.3.0:
	This version assumes you have installed OSI by yourself.
	It will detect it (along with python) through pkg-config. Where
	boost-python lives is currently hardcoded, automatic detection will be
	added in next versions.

	Users should install and configure OSI as recommended by the OSI
	project page, or through their distribution. Note that if they follow
	OSI recommendations, they will have to modify their environment
	variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH for yaposib to find OSI at compile time. They
	will also probably be required to change LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime.

0.3.1:
	Corrected a minor bug in the setup script that prevented yaposib to be
	compiled with fortmp support.
